This is a repository created to understand how GIT works
These are some updates I am making. I think we are generation that was very well placed in human history. No shortage of basic needs. No war etc. therefore this generation has not discovered anything radical. We are still looking at improving existing thigs. we are looking to improve roads, improve air travel but what we must do , in my opinion, is start working on teleportation.
